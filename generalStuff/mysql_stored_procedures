A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database system (MySQL).
The stored procedure (SP) is actually stored in the database data dictionary.
Extensive or complex processing that requires execution of several SQL statements is moved into a stored procedure, and
all applications call the procedures.

SP must be invoked using the CALL statement.

Advantages:
- Stored procedures help increase performance of the applications.
MySQL stored procedures are compiled on demand.
After compiling, MySQL stores the SP in its cache and maintains its own SP cache for every single connection.

- Stored procedure help reduce traffic between application and DB because instead of sending
multiple lengthy SQL statements, the application sends only the name of the SP.

- SP are reusable and transparent to any application, stored procedures expose the DB interface to all applications
so that developers don't have to develop functions that are already in the SP.

- Stored procedure are secure. Applications can access SP without having permissions to the underlying database tables.
 
Disadvantages:
- Many SP's will cause the memory usage for every connection to increase substantially.
A large number of logical operations will increase the CPU usage.

- Difficult to debug SP, MySQL do not allow debugging SP's
