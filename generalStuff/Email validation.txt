When checking Email addresses we need to check 2 things:
1- The structure of the Email address.
2- Check that the Email exists.

function isValidEmail($mail)
{
    if (!filter_var($mail, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) return false;
    $host = explode("@",$mail); $mxarr = array();
    if (!getmxrr($host[1], $mxarr)) return false;
    return true;
}

isValidEmailmail('test@phpguide.co.il'); // true
isValidEmail('test@phpguide444444.co.il'); // false

FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL : A built-in filter to validate Email address structure.
function getmxrr()  : Check if there is a MX record for the Email address (DNS record)

By now we know that the structure is correct and that there is a MX record
for this Email address, We still dont know that the user that entered the 
address is the user holding the Email, and we need to send a verification
Email.
