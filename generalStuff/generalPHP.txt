* PHP does not require (nor support) explicit type definition.
    If a string value is assigned to $var then $var becomes a string
    If an integer is assigned to $var it becomes an integer.

* array_merge : 
    Merges elements of one or more arrays together.
    Overwrites same string keys in both arrays.
    numeric keys are lost.
	
* usort : 
	Sort an array by values, using a user-defined comparison function.
	The callback function gets two vars and compares as defined,
	the callback function returns: x<0 (a<b), x=0 (a=b), x>0 (a>b).
	
* usleep(int time):
	Delays a program execution for the given number of micro seconds.

* set_exception_handler(callable $exception_handler):
	Sets the default exception handler(function) if an exception is not caught within a try/catch block. 
	Execution will stop after the exception_handler is called.
	

--------------------------------------------------- HTTP Request Methods start ----------------------------------------------

There are two ways the browser client can send information to the web server:
	
* GET:
	- The data is sent in the URL of a GET request.
	- GET Requests data from a specified resource.
	- GET Requests Can be cached.
	- GET Requests remain in browser history.
	- GET Requests can be bookmarked.
	- NOT for sensitive data.
	- GET Requests have length restrictions(URL has 2048 characters maximum length).
	- Should be used to retrieve data.
	- GET Requests can only pass ASCII charecters.
The sent data is visible and possibly changable, GET should not be used when sending sensetive information,
It also should not be used for actions that cause changes in the server or DB.


* POST:
	The data is sent in the HTTP message body of the POST request.
	Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
	POST requests are never cached.
	POST requests do not remain in browser history.
	POST requests can not be bookmarked.
	POST requests have no length restrictions.
