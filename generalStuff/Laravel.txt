- Composer:
A tool for dependency management in PHP.
Allows install of libraries our project needs.
Manages libraries on a project basis, will never install anythig globally.
Problems solved by the composer:
* A project thay depends on a number of libraries.
* Libraries in our project that depend on other libraries.
* I declare I depend on them.
* Composer finds out the correct version and installs the package (downloads to the project).

Composer requires PHP 5.3.2+
To install packages from sources instead of simple zip archives, 
you will need git, svn or hg depending on how the package is version-controlled.
