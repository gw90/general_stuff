----------------------Amazon S3-------------------
- An online storage facility. cheap and easy to setup.
- Can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
- Write, read and delete an unlimited number of objects.
- Each object is stored in a bucket and retrieved via a unique, developer assigned key.
- A bucket can be stored in one of several regions, depending on latency,costs or address requirements.
Uses standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces.

S3 is most suitable for webmasters and bloggers.
Can also be used CDN (content delivery network)

Use Scenarios for S3:
- Backup and Storage: Provide data backup and storage services for others.
- Application Hosting: Provide services that deploy, install, and manage web applications.
- Media Hosting: Build infrastructure that hosts video,photo,music uploads/downloads.
- Software Delivery: Host software applications that customers can download.

Can access via: 
control panel - https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
FireFox addon
smartFTP
CloudBerry Explorer

----------------------Amazon EC2-------------------
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
A web server that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
EC2 is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
EC2's web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.
EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes.
You pay for the capacity you actualy use.


EC2 functionality:
EC2 allows use of web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of
operating systems, load instances with custom application environment,
manage network access permissions and run our image using as many or few systems we desire.
- Select a pre configures , templated Amazon Machine Image.
- Configure security and network access to EC2 instance.
- Choose instance types and control them.
- Attach persistent block storage to instances.
- Pay only for resources you actually consume.

-----------------------General-----------------------
* Amazon EC2 Instance is a virtual server. 

* A bucket is Amazon S3's terminoligy for a Root folder.
It is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3.
Buckets are similar to Internet domain names.

* AMI- Amazon Machine Image - An encrypted machine image 
that containes information necessary to boot instances of your operating system
and software. Each machine or server is represented by a 
file called AMI.

----------------------Instances-------------------------
Instance Types:

- General Purpose Instances.
A balanced set or resources, a high level processing performance on 
a low cost platform. Ideal for applications that require balanced CPU
and memory performance. (Examples: encoding, high traffic content management systems and memcached).
 
- Compute Optimized Instances.
Proportionally more CPU resources than memory (RAM), well suited
for compute intensive applications.

- GPU Instances.
Provide graphics processing units (GPUs) along with high CPU and network performance
for applications benefiting from highly parallelized processing, 
including 3D graphics, HPC, rendering, and media processing applications. 

- Mempry Optimized Instances.
Large memory sizes for high throughput applications.
Database and memory caching applications.

- Storage Optimized Instances.
Very high disk I/O performance or proportionally higher density
per instance. Ideal for applications that benefit from high sequential I/O performance
across very large data sets.

- Micro Instances.
Small amount of consistent CPU resources and allow you to increase CPU capacity
in short bursts when additional cycles are available.
Suited for lower throuput applications and web sites that require additional compute cycles periodically.

----------Elastic Block Store (EBS)----------------------
Storage designed specifically for Amazon EC2 Instances.
EBS allows you to create columes that Amazon EC2 Instances can mount as devices.
