JAVA GENERAL:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java is a computer programming language that is:
Concurrent
Class-based
Object Oriented
Designed to have a few implementation dependencies as possible

The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
J2EE - Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition:
A Java centric environment by Sun, For developing, building 
and deploying Web-based applications online.

The J2EE platform consists of a set of services, API's and protocols
that provide the functionality for developing multitierd,  Web-based applications.

Key features and services of J2EE:

- At the client tier, J2EE supports pure HTML, as well as Java applets,
	It relies on Java Server Pages (JSP) and servlet code to create HTML or other formatted data for the client.

- Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) provide another layer where the platform's logic is stored,
	An EJB server provides functions such as threading, concurrency, security and memory management.

- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Java equivalent to Open Database Connectivity (ODBC),
	is the standard interface for Java databases.

- The Java servlet API enhances consistency for developers without requiring a graphical user interface (GUI).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphical user interface (GUI):
A program interface that takes advantage of the computer's graphical capabilities
to make the program easier to use.
A well designed GUI can free the user from learning complex command languages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Servlet:
A small program that runs on a server.
The term usually refers to a Java applet that runs within a Web Server environment.
Java applet is persistent, this means that once it started,
it stays in memory and can fulfil multiple requests, this way there is not time
wasted on setting up and tearing down the process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java Server Page (JSP):
A server side technology, JSP are an extension to the Java servlet technology.
JSPs have a dynamic scripting capability that works in tandem with HTML code,
separating the page logic from the static elements.
A JSP is translated into Java servlet before being run, 
and it processes HTTP requests and generates responses like any servlet. 
JSP technology provides a more convenient way to code a servlet. Translation occurs the first time the application is run
You can include output from a servlet or forward the output to a servlet, 
and a servlet can include output from a JSP or forward output to a JSP
