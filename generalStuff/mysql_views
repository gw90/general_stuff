MySQL views are essentially a way to package up SELECT statements into a re-usable virtual tables.
A view is only a prepared SQL statement that is run when you reference the view name.
Rather than repeating the associated SELECT statement, we simply reference the view.

Views are most commonly used in conjunction with JOINS 

Views are created in MySQL using the CREATE VIEW statement.
Once the view is created, we can treat it as we would a regular table in a SELECT statement.

We can see what is the underlying SELECT statement that created the view by running:
SHOW CREATE VIEW view name;

It is possible to DELETE or REPLACE a view.

A view cannot be created using subqueries.
A view does not have indexes  

Because a view is a derived table, the performance of the view is only as good as the query it is built on. 
If that query sucks, the performance issue will just snowball...
